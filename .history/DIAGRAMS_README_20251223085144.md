# Diagrams for Stock-Zen

Files generated:
- `user-flow.mmd` — Mermaid flowchart of main user and admin flows.
- `ui-sitemap.mmd` — Mermaid site-map of pages/screens and major components.

How to render:
- Use VS Code with the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" or "Mermaid Preview" extension and open the `.mmd` files.
- Or paste the Mermaid text into https://mermaid.live/ to render and export PNG/SVG/PDF.

Notes:
- Diagrams were generated by scanning `src/pages` and key components. They show main navigation and interactions (products, booking, orders, profile, admin flows, notifications).
- If you want PNG/SVG exports created automatically, I can generate them (may require installing Graphviz or using a remote Mermaid CLI).

Next options:
- Produce PNG/SVG exports of these diagrams.
- Split diagrams into separate per-persona flows or more detailed screen-by-screen wireframes.
